## Seminar Description

This seminar will follow a modern data science approach. We will use R -- one of the most popular statistical programming languages -- hands-on throughout the course. You will learn how to apply statistical methods to practical research questions in management. You will understand the importance of reproducible research and create reproducible reports and presentations.

## Entry Requirements

- Completed courses: Master Course Dimensions of Marketing Theory and Managerial Application (Modul Marketing) and Master Course Organization (Modul Organization). This is a hard requirement.

- A PC (MacOS or Windows) to install R and RStudio (both are available for free). We will use RStudio extensively throughout the course. Ideally, you would have a laptop to bring to our class meetings.

- Programming skills are not required. However, you need to be prepared to learn a programming language and to write short computer scripts in R.

- Basic understanding of quantitative research methods is highly recommended but not required. Students who do not have much prior knowledge in quantitative methods or in statistical programming will need to catch up by investing more time in (guided) self-study.
