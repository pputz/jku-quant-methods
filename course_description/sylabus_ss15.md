## Seminar Description

This seminar will follow a modern data science approach. We will use R -- one of the most popular statistical programming languages -- hands-on throughout the course. You will learn how to apply statistical methods to practical research questions in management. You will understand the importance of reproducible research and create reproducible reports and presentations.

## Entry Requirements

- 18 ECTS credits in Strategic Management, Marketing, Organization, Human Resources & Change Management, Financial and Managerial Accounting.
- Basic understanding of quantitative research methods is highly recommended but not required.
- Programming skills are not required. However, you need to be prepared to write short computer scripts in R.


## Contents

  - Introduction to the programming language R, reproducible research
  - Research designs for collecting primary and secondary data, with a special focus on the internet as a data source
  - Exploratory data analysis, statistical inference
  - Regression models, principal component analysis
  - Student project presentations


## Classes, Additional Work

Being a Master Seminar the course is on an advanced level. Students who do not have much prior knowledge in quantitative methods or in statistical programming will be able to catch up by investing more time in (guided) self-study.  


## Grading

- Class Assignments: 60%
- Team research project: 40%
- A minimum of 80% attendance is required.


## Resources

1.	Textbooks on basics:

    \fullcite{diez2014}. A free PDF version is available at www.openintro.org.
    
    \fullcite{zumel2014}.
    
    \fullcite{ghauri2010}. Some copies are available in the JKU library.

    Alternatively, for German speakers: \fullcite{lehner2012}.
    
    
2. A PC (MacOS or Windows) to install R and RStudio (both are available for free). We will use RStudio extensively throughout the course.
