## Entry Requirements

- 18 ECTS credits in Strategic Management, Marketing, Organization, Human Resources & Change Management, Financial and Managerial Accounting.
- Basic understanding of quantitative research methods is highly recommended but not required.


## Seminar Description

This seminar will follow a modern data science approach. You will learn how to apply statistical methods to practical research questions in management. You will understand the importance of reproducible research, use the programming language R hands-on, and create reproducible reports and presentations.


## Contents

  - Introduction to the programming language R, reproducible research
  - Research designs for collecting primary and secondary data, with a special focus on the internet as a data source
  - Exploratory data analysis, statistical inference
  - Regression models, principal component analysis
  - Student project presentations


## Classes, Additional Work

Being a Master Seminar the course is on an advanced level. However, students who do not have much previous knowledge in quantitative methods have the opportunity to acquire the basics in the first month of the course through self-study. For this, the first two lectures of the seminar gives an overview as a guidance for self study (see the suggestions of text books).  The block and the research project in the second half of the seminar will be on an advanced level. 


## Grading

- Class Assignments: 60%
- Team research project: 40%
- Class participation 20%  (in total a minimum of 70% of attendance is required, but 100% attendance on 14. and 15.11, exam (16.12.), and presentation (20.1.) is mandatory)
