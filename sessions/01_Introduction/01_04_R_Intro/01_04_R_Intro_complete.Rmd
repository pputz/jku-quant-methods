# Data Types and Basic Operations

## Objects {.smaller}

R has five basic or “atomic” classes of objects:

-   character
-   numeric (real numbers)
-   integer
-   complex
-   logical (True/False)

The most basic object is a vector

-   A vector can only contain objects of the same class

-   BUT: The one exception is a *list*, which is represented as a vector
    but can contain objects of different classes (indeed, that’s usually
    why we use them)

Empty vectors can be created with the ```vector()``` function.


## Numbers

-   Numbers in R a generally treated as numeric objects (i.e. double
    precision real numbers)

-   If you explicitly want an integer, you need to specify the ```L```
    suffix

-   Ex: Entering ```1``` gives you a numeric object; entering ```1L```
    explicitly gives you an integer.

-   There is also a special number ```Inf``` which represents infinity;
    e.g. ```1 / 0```; ```Inf``` can be used in ordinary calculations;
    e.g. ```1 / Inf``` is 0

-   The value ```NaN``` represents an undefined value (“not a number”);
    e.g. 0 / 0; ```NaN``` can also be thought of as a missing value
    (more on that later)



## Attributes

R objects can have attributes

-   names, dimnames

-   dimensions (e.g. matrices, arrays)

-   class

-   length

-   other user-defined attributes/metadata

Attributes of an object can be accessed using the ```attributes()```
function.



## Entering Input

At the R prompt we type expressions. The `<-` symbol is the assignment operator.

```r
> x <- 1
> print(x)
[1] 1
> x
[1] 1
> msg <- "hello"
```

The grammar of the language determines whether an expression is complete or not.

```r
> x <-  ## Incomplete expression
```

The # character indicates a comment. Anything to the right of the # (including the # itself) is ignored.



## Evaluation

When a complete expression is entered at the prompt, it is evaluated and the result of the evaluated expression is returned. The result may be auto-printed.

```r
> x <- 5  ## nothing printed
> x       ## auto-printing occurs
[1] 5
> print(x)  ## explicit printing
[1] 5
```

The `[1]` indicates that `x` is a vector and `5` is the first element.



## Printing

```r
> x <- 1:20 
> x
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
[16] 16 17 18 19 20
```

The `:` operator is used to create integer sequences.



## Creating Vectors

The `c()` function can be used to create vectors of objects.

```r
> x <- c(0.5, 0.6)       ## numeric
> x <- c(TRUE, FALSE)    ## logical
> x <- c(T, F)           ## logical
> x <- c("a", "b", "c")  ## character
> x <- 9:29              ## integer
> x <- c(1+0i, 2+4i)     ## complex
```

Using the `vector()` function

```r
> x <- vector("numeric", length = 10) 
> x
 [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```



## Mixing Objects

What about the following?

```r
> y <- c(1.7, "a")   ## character
> y <- c(TRUE, 2)    ## numeric
> y <- c("a", TRUE)  ## character
```

When different objects are mixed in a vector, _coercion_ occurs so that every element in the vector is of the same class.



## Explicit Coercion

Objects can be explicitly coerced from one class to another using the `as.*` functions, if available.

```r
> x <- 0:6
> class(x)
[1] "integer"
> as.numeric(x)
[1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
> as.logical(x)
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
> as.character(x)
[1] "0" "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6"
```



## Explicit Coercion

Nonsensical coercion results in `NA`s.

```r
> x <- c("a", "b", "c")
> as.numeric(x)
[1] NA NA NA
Warning message:
NAs introduced by coercion
> as.logical(x)
[1] NA NA NA
> as.complex(x)
[1] NA NA NA NA
Warning message:
NAs introduced by coercion
```



## Matrices

Matrices are vectors with a _dimension_ attribute. The dimension attribute is itself an integer vector of length 2 (nrow, ncol)

```r
> m <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 3) 
> m
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   NA   NA   NA
[2,]   NA   NA   NA
> dim(m)
[1] 2 3
> attributes(m)
$dim
[1] 2 3
```



## Matrices (cont’d)

Matrices are constructed _column-wise_, so entries can be thought of starting in the “upper left” corner and running down the columns.

```r
> m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3) 
> m
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    5
[2,]    2    4    6
```



## Matrices (cont’d)

Matrices can also be created directly from vectors by adding a dimension attribute.

```r
> m <- 1:10 
> m
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
> dim(m) <- c(2, 5)
> m
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    3    5    7    9
[2,]    2    4    6    8   10
```



## cbind-ing and rbind-ing

Matrices can be created by _column-binding_ or _row-binding_ with `cbind()` and `rbind()`.

```r
> x <- 1:3
> y <- 10:12
> cbind(x, y)
     x  y 
[1,] 1 10 
[2,] 2 11 
[3,] 3 12
> rbind(x, y) 
  [,1] [,2] [,3]
x    1    2    3
y   10   11   12
```



## Lists

Lists are a special type of vector that can contain elements of different classes. Lists are a very important data type in R and you should get to know them well.

```r
> x <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1 + 4i) 
> x
[[1]]
[1] 1

[[2]] 
[1] "a"

[[3]]
[1] TRUE

[[4]]
[1] 1+4i
```



## Factors

Factors are used to represent categorical data. Factors can be unordered or ordered. One can think of a factor as an integer vector where each integer has a _label_.

- Factors are treated specially by modelling functions like `lm()` and `glm()`

- Using factors with labels is _better_ than using integers because factors are self-describing; having a variable that has values “Male” and “Female” is better than a variable that has values 1 and 2.



## Factors

```r
> x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no")) 
> x
[1] yes yes no yes no
Levels: no yes
> table(x) 
x
no yes 
 2   3
> unclass(x)
[1] 2 2 1 2 1
attr(,"levels")
[1] "no"  "yes"
```



## Factors

The order of the levels can be set using the `levels` argument to `factor()`. This can be important in linear modelling because the first level is used as the baseline level.
```r
> x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"),
              levels = c("yes", "no"))
> x
[1] yes yes no yes no 
Levels: yes no
```



## Missing Values

Missing values are denoted by `NA` or `NaN` for undefined mathematical operations. 

- `is.na()` is used to test objects if they are `NA`

- `is.nan()` is used to test for `NaN`

- `NA` values have a class also, so there are integer `NA`, character `NA`, etc.

- A `NaN` value is also `NA` but the converse is not true



## Missing Values

```r
> x <- c(1, 2, NA, 10, 3)
> is.na(x)
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
> is.nan(x)
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
> x <- c(1, 2, NaN, NA, 4)
> is.na(x)
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
> is.nan(x)
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
```



## Data Frames

Data frames are used to store tabular data

- They are represented as a special type of list where every element of the list has to have the same length

- Each element of the list can be thought of as a column and the length of each element of the list is the number of rows

- Unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column (just like lists); matrices must have every element be the same class

- Data frames also have a special attribute called `row.names`

- Data frames are usually created by calling `read.table()` or `read.csv()`

- Can be converted to a matrix by calling `data.matrix()`



## Data Frames

```r
> x <- data.frame(foo = 1:4, bar = c(T, T, F, F)) 
> x
  foo   bar
1   1  TRUE
2   2  TRUE
3   3 FALSE
4   4 FALSE
> nrow(x)
[1] 4
> ncol(x)
[1] 2
```



## Names

R objects can also have names, which is very useful for writing readable code and self-describing objects.

```r
> x <- 1:3
> names(x)
NULL
> names(x) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf") 
> x
foo bar norf 
  1   2    3
> names(x)
[1] "foo"  "bar"  "norf"
```



## Names

Lists can also have names.

```r
> x <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3) 
> x
$a
[1] 1

$b 
[1] 2

$c 
[1] 3
```



## Names

And matrices.

```r
> m <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
> dimnames(m) <- list(c("a", "b"), c("c", "d")) 
> m
  c d 
a 1 3 
b 2 4
```

# Reading and Writing Data



## Reading Data

There are a few principal functions reading data into R.

- `read.table`, `read.csv`, for reading tabular data 
- `readLines`, for reading lines of a text file
- `source`, for reading in R code files (`inverse` of `dump`) 
- `dget`, for reading in R code files (`inverse` of `dput`)
- `load`, for reading in saved workspaces
- `unserialize`, for reading single R objects in binary form



## Writing Data

There are analogous functions for writing data to files

- write.table
- writeLines
- dump
- dput
- save
- serialize



## Reading Data Files with read.table

The `read.table` function is one of the most commonly used functions for reading data. It has a few important arguments:

- `file`, the name of a file, or a connection
- `header`, logical indicating if the file has a header line
- `sep`, a string indicating how the columns are separated
- `colClasses`, a character vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset 
- `nrows`, the number of rows in the dataset
- `comment.char`, a character string indicating the comment character
- `skip`, the number of lines to skip from the beginning
- `stringsAsFactors`, should character variables be coded as factors?



## read.table

For small to moderately sized datasets, you can usually call read.table without specifying any other arguments

```r
data <- read.table("foo.txt")
```

R will automatically

- skip lines that begin with a #
- figure out how many rows there are (and how much memory needs to be allocated)
- figure what type of variable is in each column of the table

Telling R all these things directly makes R run faster and more efficiently.

- `read.csv` is identical to read.table except that the default separator is a comma.



## Reading in Larger Datasets with read.table

With much larger datasets, doing the following things will make your life easier and will prevent R from choking.

- Read the help page for read.table, which contains many hints
- Make a rough calculation of the memory required to store your dataset. If the dataset is larger than the amount of RAM on your computer, you can probably stop right here.
- Set `comment.char = ""` if there are no commented lines in your file.



## Reading in Larger Datasets with read.table

- Use the `colClasses` argument. Specifying this option instead of using the default can make ’read.table’ run MUCH faster, often twice as fast. In order to use this option, you have to know the class of each column in your data frame. If all of the columns are “numeric”, for example, then you can just set `colClasses = "numeric"`. A quick an dirty way to figure out the classes of each column is the following:

```r
initial <- read.table("datatable.txt", nrows = 100)
classes <- sapply(initial, class)
tabAll <- read.table("datatable.txt",
                     colClasses = classes)
```

- Set `nrows`. This doesn’t make R run faster but it helps with memory usage. A mild overestimate is okay. You can use the Unix tool `wc` to calculate the number of lines in a file.



## Know Thy System

In general, when using R with larger datasets, it’s useful to know a few things about your system.

- How much memory is available?
- What other applications are in use?
- Are there other users logged into the same system? 
- What operating system?
- Is the OS 32 or 64 bit?



## Calculating Memory Requirements

I have a data frame with 1,500,000 rows and 120 columns, all of which are numeric data. Roughly, how much memory is required to store this data frame?


1,500,000 × 120 × 8 bytes/numeric 

  = 1440000000 bytes
  
  = 1440000000 / $2^{20}$ bytes/MB  
  
  = 1,373.29 MB
  
  = 1.34 GB                     


## Textual Formats

- `dumping` and dputing are useful because the resulting textual format is edit-able, and in the case of corruption, potentially recoverable.
- `Unlike` writing out a table or csv file, `dump` and `dput` preserve the _metadata_ (sacrificing some readability), so that another user doesn’t have to specify it all over again.
- `Textual` formats can work much better with version control programs like subversion or git which can only track changes meaningfully in text files
- Textual formats can be longer-lived; if there is corruption somewhere in the file, it can be easier to fix the problem
- Textual formats adhere to the “Unix philosophy” 
- Downside: The format is not very space-efficient




## dput-ting R Objects

Another way to pass data around is by deparsing the R object with dput and reading it back in using `dget`.

```r
> y <- data.frame(a = 1, b = "a")
> dput(y)
structure(list(a = 1,
               b = structure(1L, .Label = "a",
                             class = "factor")),
          .Names = c("a", "b"), row.names = c(NA, -1L),
          class = "data.frame")
> dput(y, file = "y.R")
> new.y <- dget("y.R")
> new.y
   a  b 
1  1  a
```



## Dumping R Objects

Multiple objects can be deparsed using the dump function and read back in using `source`.

```r
> x <- "foo"
> y <- data.frame(a = 1, b = "a")
> dump(c("x", "y"), file = "data.R") 
> rm(x, y)
> source("data.R")
> y
  a  b 
1 1  a
> x
[1] "foo"
```



## Interfaces to the Outside World

Data are read in using _connection_ interfaces. Connections can be made to files (most common) or to other more exotic things.

- `file`, opens a connection to a file
- `gzfile`, opens a connection to a file compressed with gzip
- `bzfile`, opens a connection to a file compressed with bzip2 
- `url`, opens a connection to a webpage



## File Connections

```r
> str(file)
function (description = "", open = "", blocking = TRUE,
          encoding = getOption("encoding"))
```

- `description` is the name of the file 
- `open` is a code indicating
  - “r” read only
  - “w” writing (and initializing a new file)
  - “a” appending
  - “rb”, “wb”, “ab” reading, writing, or appending in binary mode (Windows)



## Connections

In general, connections are powerful tools that let you navigate files or other external objects. In practice, we often don’t need to deal with the connection interface directly.

```r
con <- file("foo.txt", "r")
data <- read.csv(con)
close(con)
```

is the same as

```r
data <- read.csv("foo.txt")
```



## Reading Lines of a Text File

```r
> con <- gzfile("words.gz") 
> x <- readLines(con, 10) 
> x
 [1] "1080"     "10-point" "10th"     "11-point"
 [5] "12-point" "16-point" "18-point" "1st"
 [9] "2"        "20-point"
```

`writeLines` takes a character vector and writes each element one line at a time to a text file.



## Reading Lines of a Text File

`readLines` can be useful for reading in lines of webpages

```r
## This might take time
con <- url("http://www.jhsph.edu", "r")
x <- readLines(con)
> head(x)
[1] "<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\">"
[2] ""
[3] "<html>"
[4] "<head>"
[5] "\t<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;charset=utf-8
```




# Subsetting

## Subsetting

There are a number of operators that can be used to extract subsets of R objects.
- `[` always returns an object of the same class as the original; can be used to select more than one element (there is one exception)

- `[[` is used to extract elements of a list or a data frame; it can only be used to extract a single element and the class of the returned object will not necessarily be a list or data frame

- `$` is used to extract elements of a list or data frame by name; semantics are similar to that of `[[`.



## Subsetting

```r
> x <- c("a", "b", "c", "c", "d", "a")
> x[1]
[1] "a"
> x[2]
[1] "b"
> x[1:4]
[1] "a" "b" "c" "c"
> x[x > "a"]
[1] "b" "c" "c" "d"
> u <- x > "a"
> u
[1] FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE 
> x[u]
[1] "b" "c" "c" "d"
```



## Subsetting a Matrix

Matrices can be subsetted in the usual way with (_i,j_) type indices.

```r
> x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
> x[1, 2]
[1] 3
> x[2, 1]
[1] 2
```

Indices can also be missing.

```r
> x[1, ]
[1] 1 3 5
> x[, 2]
[1] 3 4
```



## Subsetting a Matrix

By default, when a single element of a matrix is retrieved, it is returned as a vector of length 1 rather than a 1 × 1 matrix. This behavior can be turned off by setting `drop = FALSE`.

```r
> x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
> x[1, 2]
[1] 3
> x[1, 2, drop = FALSE]
     [,1]
[1,] 3
```



## Subsetting a Matrix

Similarly, subsetting a single column or a single row will give you a vector, not a matrix (by default).

```r
> x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
> x[1, ]
[1] 1 3 5
> x[1, , drop = FALSE]
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    5
```



## Subsetting Lists

```r
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼6/14
Subsetting Lists
> x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = 0.6)
> x[1]
$foo
[1] 1 2 3 4

> x[[1]]
[1] 1 2 3 4

> x$bar
[1] 0.6
> x[["bar"]]
[1] 0.6
> x["bar"]
$bar
[1] 0.6
```



## Subsetting Lists

```r
> x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = 0.6, baz = "hello")
> x[c(1, 3)]
$foo
[1] 1 2 3 4

$baz
[1] "hello"
```



## Subsetting Lists

The `[[` operator can be used with _computed_ indices; `$` can only be used with literal names.

```r
> x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = 0.6, baz = "hello")
> name <- "foo"
> x[[name]]  ## computed index for ‘foo’
[1] 1 2 3 4
> x$name     ## element ‘name’ doesn’t exist!
NULL
> x$foo
[1] 1 2 3 4  ## element ‘foo’ does exist
```



## Subsetting Nested Elements of a List

The `[[` can take an integer sequence.

```r
> x <- list(a = list(10, 12, 14), b = c(3.14, 2.81))
> x[[c(1, 3)]]
[1] 14
> x[[1]][[3]]
[1] 14

> x[[c(2, 1)]]
[1] 3.14
```



## Partial Matching

Partial matching of names is allowed with `[[` and `$`.

```r
> x <- list(aardvark = 1:5)
> x$a
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
> x[["a"]]
NULL
> x[["a", exact = FALSE]]
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
```



## Removing NA Values

A common task is to remove missing values (`NA`s).

```r
> x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, NA, 5)
> bad <- is.na(x)
> x[!bad]
[1] 1 2 4 5
```



## Removing NA Values

What if there are multiple things and you want to take the subset with no missing values?

```r
> x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, NA, 5)
> y <- c("a", "b", NA, "d", NA, "f")
> good <- complete.cases(x, y)
> good
[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
> x[good]
[1] 1 2 4 5
> y[good]
[1] "a" "b" "d" "f"
```



## Removing NA Values

```r
> airquality[1:6, ]
  Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day

7    23     299  8.6   65     5   7
```
