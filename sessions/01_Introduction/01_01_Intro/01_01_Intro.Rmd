# Motivation for this Course


## Evidence Based Management

"... the idea that decisions ... should be based on the latest and best knowledge of what actually works" [Pfeffer & Sutton, 2006](https://hbr.org/2006/01/evidence-based-management)

Why is it hard?

>- There's too much evidience
>- There's not enough good evidence
>- The evidence doesn't quite apply
>- People are trying to mislead you
>- You are trying to mislead you
>- The side effects outweigh the cure
>- Stories are more persuasive anyway


## Evidence Based Management

<div class="columns-2">

Typical research process in EBMgt is similar to academic research.

## Big Data {.flexbox .vcenter}

In 2010, the [Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/15579717) published the article **"The data deluge"**.

"Businesses, governments and society are only starting to tap its vast potential."

## Why R? The Big Picture {.build}

<div class="columns-2">
>- R is becoming the “lingua franca” of data science
>- Companies are using R (Google, Facebook, Microsoft)
>- R is [popular in academia](http://www.nature.com/news/programming-tools-adventures-with-r-1.16609)

## Why R? The Hands-On View

>- It is free
>- It has a comprehensive set of packages
    * Data access
    * Data cleaning
    * Analysis
    * Data reporting
>- It has one of the best development environments - Rstudio [http://www.rstudio.com/](http://www.rstudio.com/)
>- It has an amazing ecosystem of developers
>- Packages are easy to install and "play nicely together"
