# Motivation for this Course


## Evidence Based Management

"... the idea that decisions ... should be based on the latest and best knowledge of what actually works" [Pfeffer & Sutton, 2006](https://hbr.org/2006/01/evidence-based-management)

Why is it hard?

>- There's too much evidience
>- There's not enough good evidence
>- The evidence doesn't quite apply
>- People are trying to mislead you
>- You are trying to mislead you
>- The side effects outweigh the cure
>- Stories are more persuasive anyway

## Why R? The Big Picture {.build}

<div class="columns-2">
>- R is becoming the “lingua franca” of data science
>- Companies are using R (Google, Facebook, Microsoft)
>- R is [popular in academia](http://www.nature.com/news/programming-tools-adventures-with-r-1.16609)

## Why ![R logo](../../assets/img/01/Rlogo-2.png)? The Hands-On View

>- It is free
>- It has a comprehensive set of packages
    * Data access
    * Data cleaning
    * Analysis
    * Data reporting
>- It has one of the best development environments - Rstudio [http://www.rstudio.com/](http://www.rstudio.com/)
>- It has an amazing ecosystem of developers
>- Packages (i.e. extensions) are easy to install and "play nicely together"
