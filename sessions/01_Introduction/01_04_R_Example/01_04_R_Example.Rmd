## Research Question

Are cars with manual or automatic transmission   
more fuel efficient?


## Loading Data

```{r load}
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)
```

## Exploring Data Set

```{r explore1}
?mtcars
str(mtcars)
```

## Simple Summaries

```{r explore2}
summary(mtcars$mpg)
table(mtcars$am)
```

## Fuel Effieciency by Transmission Type

```{r mpg_by_am}
am_means <- aggregate(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars, mean)
am_means
```

## Boxplot Fuel Efficiency

```{r boxplot}
boxplot(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars, 
        main = "Fuel Efficiency by Transmission Type",
        ylab = "mpg",
        names = c("automatic", "manual"))
```
